    3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS

        3.1. Availability of Source Code

        Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
        in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form
        and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms
        of this License.  You must include a copy of this License with every
        copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute
        or otherwise make available.  You must inform recipients of any such
        Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such
        Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
        through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

        3.2. Modifications

        The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
        governed by the terms of this License.  You represent that You
        believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
        have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

        3.3. Required Notices

        You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
        identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may not
        remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
        within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any
        descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the
        Initial Developer.

        3.4. Application of Additional Terms

        You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
        Source Code form that imposes restrictions in addition to those
        applicable under this version of the License or the recipients'
        rights hereunder.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
        warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
        recipients of Covered Software.  However, you may do so only on Your
        own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
        Contributor.  You must make it absolutely clear that any such
        warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
        You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
        and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
        Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability terms You offer.

        3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions

        You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under
        the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
        choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
        provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
        and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
        limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
        the rights set forth in this License.  If You distribute the Covered
        Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
        it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
        are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
        Contributor.  You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
        and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
        Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
        offer.

        3.6. Larger Works

        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
        other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
        the Larger Work as a single product.  In such a case, You must make
        sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
        Software.

        3.7. Academic Work

        Should You publish any Academic Work which is based in full or in
        part on the Covered Software which You have Modified, You must
        ensure that any Modifications which You have made are also made
        available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be
        distributed under terms compatible with this License.  You must
        inform recipients of any such Academic Work as to how they can
        obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable
        manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
        exchange.

    4. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE

        4.1. New Versions

        The Initial Developer is the initial license steward and may publish
        revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time.  Each
        version will be given a distinguishing version number.  No one other
        than the license steward has the right to modify this License.

        4.2. Effect of New Versions

        You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
        Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
        License under which You originally received the Covered Software.

        4.3. Applicability of New Versions

        The Initial Developer has the right to use, distribute or otherwise
        make the Covered Software available under the terms of the new
        version of this License, provided that such terms do not restrict
        Your rights under the current version, as described in Section 2.

    5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
    WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF
    DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. 
    THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED
    SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN
    ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR)
    ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS
    DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. 
    NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS

    6. TERMINATION

        6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
        cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. 
        Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
        termination of this License shall survive.

        6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
        declaratory judgment actions) against the Initial Developer or a
        Contributor (the Participant) alleging that the "Participant
        Software" (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is
        a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the
        Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
        any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such
        Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not
        the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
        of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant
        terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such
        60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You
        withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against
        such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written
        agreement with Participant.

        6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
        all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
        distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
        granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

    7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
    DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
    SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY
    PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
    OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST
    PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
    MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF
    SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
    THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR
    PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
    APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
    ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS

    The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
    48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
    software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and
    "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in
    48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
    C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government
    End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth
    herein.  This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and
    supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that
    addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.

    9. MISCELLANEOUS

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
    hereof.  If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
    such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
    enforceable.  This License shall be governed by the law of the country
    where the Participant is a citizen (or registered, in the case of
    corporate entities), except to the extent applicable law, if any,
    provides otherwise.  Any litigation relating to this License shall be
    subject to the jurisdiction of the nearest suitable courts to the
    current residence or registered address of the Participant, except if
    both parties agree to a change of venue prior to the commencement court
    proceedings.  Should a legal dispute arise, in which You are involved,
    You agree to exhaust alternative means of dispute resolution, such as
    mediation or arbitration, before resorting to litigation.  Any law or
    regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
    construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.  You
    agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the export
    control laws and regulations of any country involved when You use,
    distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

    10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS

    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out
    of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work
    with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
    responsibility on an equitable basis.  Nothing herein is intended or
    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
